C_v measure uses normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI) and the cosine similarity

C_p used one-preceding segmentation of the top words and the confirmation measure of Fitelsonâ€™s coherence

C_uci uses the pointwise mutual information (PMI) of all word pairs of the given top words

C_umass uses a one-preceding segmentation and a logarithmic conditional probability as confirmation measure

C_npmi is an enhanced version of the C_uci coherence using the normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI)

C_a uses a pairwise comparison of the top words and normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI) and the cosine similarity
